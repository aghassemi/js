## Vanadium JavaScript API
Vanadium is an ongoing effort to build an open source, cross-platform application framework for secure, cross-device user experiences.

[Vanadium module](./module-vanadium.html) provides JavaScript APIs into its application environment to enable development of Vanadium-based applications in JavaScript. These applications currently work in NodeJS and in the desktop Chrome browser.

## [Vanadium Module](./module-vanadium.html)
[Vanadium module](./module-vanadium.html) is the entry point to the public Vanadium API.

[Runtime](./module-vanadium-Runtime.html), as returned by the
[init](module-vanadium.html#.init) function, defines entry points to create servers, client, blessing and other Vanadium functionality.
